    PHP 5 features a completely revamped XML support and also comes
    with a quite robust web services stack. This sessopm will give you
    a run-through of the most important (and interesting) XML features
    in PHP; then, PHP's web services support (and alternative,
    external packages) is demonstrated.  The session closes with a
    look ahead at what the future will bring, especially with regards
    to modern web services standards like the WS-* stack.

Abstract: >-

    Web 2.0 took the internet world by storm. Especially attackers
    welcome the new possibilities created by Ajax, the increased use
    of JavaScript, opening up applications via web services, and user
    generated content. This session shows common pitfalls with modern
    "Web 2.0" applications and help you to avoid becoming the next
    victim on the ever-growing list. Web security has not changed that
    much, but web applications have. Ajax introduced new and dangerous
    attacks, and it is vital to know appropriate countermeasures. Come
    to this (technology-agnostic) session to learn best practices for
    state-of-the-art websites.

Abstract: >-

  Almost every project has users who depend on it, even if that
  project is reaching the end of its development lifecycle. We owe it
  to that user base to give every open source project a graceful
  sendoff. Incorporating lessons learned from the retirement of Apache
  Axis 1.x and the transition of its user base to Apache Axis2, this
  talk will discuss best practices and anti-patterns for retiring an
  open source project, including tips on how to ease the pain of
  legacy users as well as how to migrate your users to a new or
  replacement technology.

  You come to work on Monday morning to learn that your company is
  adopting this new version of Struts. At first you are excited to
  learn a modern web framework but you have also heard it is quite
  different from Struts Classic. What does this mean for your career?
  What if you are no longer the person everyone calls the Struts guru?
  How do you quickly become the Struts 2 expert you know you can be?
  Luckily, you have already taken the first step by attending Java
  One!  With Struts being the most popular Java web framework in the
  industry today, IT shops are excited to hit the ground running with
  this next generation web framework. This session will provide a
  primer for Struts Classic developers needing a Struts 2 head
  start. We will compare and contrast Struts 2 to its predecessor and
  highlight the areas where Struts 2 breaks away from the past and
  blazes new trails into Ajax, validations, plug-in architecture and
  the interceptor architecture that allow nearly infinite
  flexibility. This session will transition your expert status to the
  new Struts before anyone realizes your confidence was ever shaken! A
  complete reference application will be made available to the
  participant in order to become effective in minutes not days.

    With the massive rise in both structured and unstructured data
    comes the need to better understand what is in the data.  Machine
    Learning algorithms are often designed to make sense of large
    volumes of data with minimal human input. In this talk, we cover
    some of the basic algorithms of machine learning (without all the
    gory math) and show how the new Apache Mahout project is
    attempting to solve these problems in a scalable way by utilizing
    Hadoop.

    "So you're considering a production deployment of ActiveMQ.  I'm
    sure you have some questions. Such as: How can the broker be
    clustered to improve scalability or guarantee availability?  How
    should clients be configured for failover? How do we monitor
    individual messages, queue depths, or other broker statistics?
    What's the best approach if a producer or consumer may be down
    for some time (e.g. a maintenance window)? What kind of hardware
    is needed for a throughput of ## messages per second? What are the
    security options? What's the real difference between persistence
    strategies? What's the best way to connect non-Java clients? In
    this talk we'll address all these questions and more (bring a few
    of your own!). You'll walk away with the knowledge you need to be
    confident putting ActiveMQ into production."

    The revered Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) book is
    indispensable for handling messaging-based integration, but
    utilizing these patterns in your own code can be tedious,
    especially if you have to write the code from scratch every
    time. Wouldn't it be nice if you had a simple API for these
    patterns that makes this easier? Enter Apache Camel, a message
    routing and mediation engine that provides a POJO-based
    implementation of the EIP patterns and a wonderfully simple Domain
    Specific Language (DSL) for expressing message routes.  This
    session will introduce and demonstrate the power of Camel. So go
    on, take a Camel ride!

  One of the main new features in Apache 2.2 is the enhancement of the
  proxy module, allowing Apache to proxy not only HTTP as before, but
  also AJP. Coupled with the dynamic load balancing capability also
  new in 2.2, see why Apache is now an even more capable reverse
  proxy, and see why mod_jk may no longer be required. Included are
  helpful real-world hints in configuration for high-availability
  failover environments.

    host DAV repositories, and how to use end-user applications to use
    those repositories. We'll talk about various popular DAV-based
    applications such as iCal and Sunbird (Calendaring), Subversion
    (Revision control), and various web development packages that use
    DAV as their file transfer method. This talk is geared to the
    beginner or intermediate user who is somewhat familiar with the

Abstract: >-

  Many projects use at least some of them - the Commons (former
  Jakarta Commons) libraries. Small reusable libraries simplifying the
  day-to-day work of thousands of java programmers. But over time the
  Commons project has grown and the number of components makes it
  harder and harder to keep track. This session will try to give an
  overview of the components available and how the community is
  organized.

Abstract: >-

  One of the most difficult things to do (in Java) is to build a
  search engine: For a local website, a group of sites or even a large
  part of the WorldWideWeb. The Apache Software Foundation hosts the
  most popular open source solutions on this topic: Nutch and
  Lucene. This session will introduce these frameworks and explain how
  they depend on each other.  It will briefly explain how they handle
  search queries / data storage and outline the strengths and
  weaknesses of each.  Tips and tricks will be plentiful. Lastly, it
  will provide attendees with a sample application that uses both
  Nutch and Lucene for site search at a JSP web application. At the
  end, session includes at simple setup for a search server that can
  be used for any data, working as a webservice.

Abstract: >-

  Application development by large groups of developers is one of
  the most demanding problems in software industry. Also, open source
  projects are getting sometimes in this trouble.  Mostly they try to
  solve it by using Subversion / CVS code management - but there are
  really more ways to do this. This session outlines the possibilities
  of decentralized development offers to small and midsized groups of
  developers: Completely working without any central server. It also
  shows the networking opportunities of Eclipse and NetBeans. Many
  tips and tricks as well as some case studies will be shown finally.

    Apache Solr is an HTTP based enterprise search server built on top
    of the Lucene Java search library. In this session we will see how
    quick and easy it can be to install and configure Solr to provide
    full-text searching of structured data without needing to write
    any custom code. We will demonstrate various built-in features
    such as: loading data from CSV files, tolerant parsing of user
    input, faceted searching, highlighting matched text in results,
    and retrieving search results in a variety of formats (XML, JSON,
    etc....) We will also look at using Solr's Administrative
    interface to understand how different text analysis configuration
    options affect our results, and why various results score the way
    they do against different searches. No previous Solr experience is
    expected.

    In the session we give an introduction into Apache Droids, the
    intelligent standalone robot framework, and develop a custom
    robot. The core is a simple crawler which can be easily extended
    by plugins to automatically seek out relevant information and
    invoke arbitrary business logic. If a project needs special
    processing for a crawled url the developer can easily write a
    plugin to implement the functionality. The project started as an
    Apache Labs project and entered the Apache Incubator with Apache
    HttpComponents as mentoring project. Apache Nutch is another
    famous robot on Apache but for some use cases just too specific,
    this is where Droids enters the stage.

Abstract: >-

  Groovy provides excellent facilities for parsing and creating
  XML. As well as providing syntactic sugar on top of traditional
  Java-based parsing approaches (e.g. SAX, DOM, StAX), it has its own
  XmlParser and XmlSlurper libraries which support XPath-like
  expressions at the object level (akin to LINQ in the .Net world). It
  also integrates nicely with XPath, XQuery, XSLT as well as with
  popular XML libraries. Groovy's markup builders provide an elegant
  and efficient way to create and modify XML.  All these features can
  work with Apache Xerces or with native XML support on 1.4 through to
  1.7 JVMs. In addition to its base XML capabilities, Groovy modules
  exist for doing XML-RPC, REST and SOAP Web Services including RSS,
  ATOM and other popular XML dialects. Groovy-WS is based on Apache
  CXF and provides a simple and elegant way to create Web Services
  without the need for worrying about stubs.

Abstract: >-

    Intrusion detection is a well-known network security technique --
    it introduces monitoring and correlation devices to networks,
    enabling administrators to monitor events and detect attacks and
    anomalies in real-time. Web intrusion detection does the same but
    it works on the HTTP level, making it suitable to deal with
    security issues in web applications.  This session will start with
    an overview of web intrusion detection and web application
    firewalls, discussing where they belong in the overall protection
    strategy. The second part of the talk will discuss ModSecurity and
    its capabilities.  ModSecurity is an open source web application
    firewall that can be deployed either embedded (in the Apache HTTP
    server) or as a network gateway (as part of a reverse proxy
    deployment).  Now in it's fifth year of development, ModSecurity
    is mature, robust and flexible. Due to its popularity and wide
    usage it is now positioned as a de-facto standard in the web
    intrusion detection space.

Abstract: >-

  Apache Velocity is mostly considered an exciting alternative to
  the ubiquitous Java Server pages for web apps. But Velocity is much
  more. As a general purpose templating engine written in Java it is
  at the heart of code generators, mass mail senders or documentation
  frameworks. This talk gives an overview over the language features
  and the integration of Velocity into your own applications.

    Apache Maven is a powerful and extensible tool for managing
    software build and project information. When used effectively, it
    can greatly simplify a project's build, reduce maintenance,
    improve automation and make producing consistent releases
    simple. However, it is also easy to encounter common pit falls
    that lead to unwieldly or problematic Maven set-ups. This
    presentation will focus on identifying the best practices when
    using Maven and it's related technologies, and the pitfalls to
    avoid. It covers new topics such as integration testing, plugin
    development, documentation and reporting structure, and archetype
    creation along with an overview of the essential best practices
    for any Maven build.

    What are the core requirements for a set of team collaboration
    tools? Looking at how ASF project communities collaborate online,
    we have identified four core drivers that help these projects
    succeed. We will show how the collaboration tools used by the ASF
    can allow any project team to move from an "ask around the office"
    collaboration model to our efficient "distributed self service
    information" model, while focusing on those core drivers to avoid
    being distracted by the tools themselves. Our analysis will help
    you estimate the effort and expected benefits of such a move.

  Like most large websites, ticketmaster.com contains a lot of code,
  spread across proxies, cache systems, databases, black boxes,
  etc. At the heart of it all more than 400,000 lines of custom Perl
  code spread across more than 1500perl modules.  Keeping that much
  code optimized for performance is no easy task - all code has
  bottlenecks, but the trick is figuring out where they (really)
  are. "Premature optimization is the root of all evil... the ability
  to accurately determine what is premature separates great developers
  from merely capable ones." This session will introduce basic code
  profiling concepts and the Perl tools that savvy developers use
  every day, enabling them to properly identify optimization
  opportunities in their code. From there, we will advance into the
  profiling techniques used to tune ticketmaster.com, which you will
  be able to apply to your own Perl-based applications.  In all, you
  will leave with the knowledge you need to bring your Perl coding
  skills to the next level.

Abstract: >-

    The social web is already reality and it makes applications
    available to more users by providing common APIs that can be used
    in many different contexts. OpenSocial is an API that can be used
    by developers to create applications, using standard JavaScript
    and HTML. These applications run on social websites that have
    implemented the OpenSocial APIs. Such websites, known as
    OpenSocial containers, allow developers to access their social
    information; in return they receive a large suite of applications
    for their users. Apache Shindig is a brand new incubator podling
    implementing the OpenSocial APIs. This talk describes Shindig in
    depth and shows how it can be embedded into a larger web
    application to enable it to host OpenSocial apps.

Abstract: >-

    Documentation is often seen as the 'ugly sister' of open source
    work. Everyone knows they need it, but no one wants to write
    it. But writing documentation doesn't need to be a pain, and the
    advantages of having usable documentation are many.  This talk
    will briefly introduce the need for documentation, and discuss the
    benefits that good documentation can bring to a software
    project. The talk will go on to look at effective communication
    with users from a variety of angles: letting them know that
    documentation exists, helping them to find the documentation that
    they need, and making sure that it's written in a language that
    they can understand. Finally, the talk will cover some of the
    different types of documentation an open-source project needs: the
    different audiences that need to be addressed, and how to improve
    documentation overall by speaking to each of those audiences
    seperately, rather than trying to communicate everything at once.

Abstract: >-

    Apache Tika is an extensible content analysis toolkit designed for
    detecting and extracting metadata and structured text content from
    a large number of document formats. It represents an higher level
    layer over existing parser libraries. World-class content
    management systems, and most of all enterprise document management
    focused ones, always have to face the challenge of detecting,
    extracting and indexing as more various media content types as
    possible. This session provides a technical presentation on how
    you can integrate Tika inside an Enterprise Document Management
    System, in order to centralize media type detection implementation
    and leverage dedicated parsers behind a common extraction layer.
    Partecipants will also learn how Tika is integrated with Lucene in
    order to provide high performance document indexing and searching
    features. As a real life demostration, the most recent supported
    media types, Office Open XML (OOXML), will be detected, extracted
    and indexed.

  benefits? How can it help you develop your applications? And what
  the BPEL standard is good and bad for?  This session will try to
  answer to all of these questions by showing you how you can easily
  describe complex processes and transactions using BPEL and how you
  can leverage your existing software architecture to quickly
  implement new applications.  Doing so, we'll cover multiple design
  techniques, best practices for BPEL development, integration with
  REST/WS-* and scripting technologies, as well as discuss pitfalls
  and anti-patterns.

Abstract: >-

  Tuscany is an Apache Incubator project providing support for
  building SOA-based application networks. It is based on the Service
  Component Architecture specifications being defined by the OASIS
  Open SCA Collaboration. Felix is an Apache project providing an
  implementation of the Java modularity and service technology defined
  by the OSGi Alliance. Tuscany was built with a modular architecture,
  using a different approach from that of OSGi. In 2007 an effort was
  started to integrate Tuscany with OSGi. As part of this we undertook
  an investigation into how to apply OSGi modularity to the Tuscany
  runtime to enable its execution within an OSGi Framework. This
  involved analyzing the existing Tuscany modularity which turned up
  lots of interesting information about the linkages between the
  various sub-components. This understanding was then used to
  determine how to map Tuscany into a suitable form for use as OSGi
  bundles, including prototyping various levels of decomposition
  granularity. This presentation will share the experiences of
  analyzing and modularizing an existing project using OSGi.  It will
  discuss what to expect when approaching modularizing existing
  projects, the tools for aiding analysis and best practices for
  applying OSGi modularity.

Abstract: >-

    Enterprise installations of Apache are particularly attractive
    targets for malicious attacks including Denial of Service,
    defacement, theft of data or service and installation of zombies
    or viruses. Hardening your deployment against such attacks calls
    for some special techniques and tactics. Come to this session to
    learn about attack detection techniques, server protection, secure
    deployment of multiple servers, configuration of firewall
    “demilitarized zones” and judicious use of SSL encryption. How do
    you deploy an off-the-shelf application that insists on writing to
    the file system? And what steps do you take to securely deploy
    Apache on Windows or UNIX? This presentation will explore
    solutions to these very real situations.

Abstract: >-

    This lecture will give you a short introduction of what
    "dependency management" is, what are the different approaches for
    a dependency management, what is the history of Ivy and last but
    not least, how you can benefit from using Ivy. The presentation I
    am about to prepare will be divided into 4 main parts. The target
    group of the following presentation is supposed to have little or
    no experience with Ivy. Although, it is a good point to have some
    experience with Ant and Maven, it in not a necessity. The first
    part is the "introductory" part. Here I will start by explaining
    what the build lifecycle is and what are the main problems that
    arise at build time, so that you can later on see how Ivy really
    solves these problems. Here I will talk about the concept of
    "dependency management", and what exactly it is. I think
    approximately 10 or 15 minutes would be enough. The second part
    provides with the knowledge details of what are the other
    solutions for dependency management, and what makes Ivy
    unique. Also what are the strong and weak sides of Ivy. Again may
    be 10 or 15 min will be sufficient. The last part would be the
    most interesting part of all - showing you the Ivy project in
    action. This time I will grab a certain project and resolve it's
    dependencies on air with Ivy, showing in real how easy it is, to
    work with this tool. I will try to cover all the data and
    knowledge that I have presented in the past two sections in
    practice. I leave maximum of 15 minutes for this part. As always I
    will leave 5 or 10 minutes for talk with the audience and
    questions.

  This session introduces the configuration of the mod_dav and the
  mod_ftp modules to provide a comprehensive platform for managing web
  contents, while serving generated content.  Secure solutions which
  leverage mod_ssl and Apache's authorization and authentication
  features permit writable web spaces allowing the web author to
  manage files and end-users to submit files.  Site administrators
  gain a comprehensive, integrated solution to the contrasting
  requirements of managing versus serving content.

Abstract: >-

    The Atom Publishing Protocol is described in RFC5023, completed in
    2007. There are a variety of implementations with good
    interoperability. mod_atom is an implementation of the APP as an
    apache module. Its goals are simplicity and performance are
    important. To have multiple APP-updatable publications, you should
    need only one line in an httpd config file, and you should ideally
    be able to flow updates into multiple publications in parallel at
    available network wire speeds.  mod_atom, now available on
    Googlecode, attempts to achieve high performance via tight
    integration with httpd and use of the unadorned filesystem as a
    backing store. Early test results indicate high performance; by
    Apachecon, there will be fairly comprehensive results about how
    fast mod_atom can go and how to tune httpd to achieve this. Apache
    httpd is currently how a large part of the material that's
    retrieved from the web is retrieved. With APP in general and
    mod_atom in particular, it could become the vehicle via which a
    high proportion of the Web's content is stored as well as
    retrieved.

  CNET Networks owns a global network of popular web sites with a
  combined average daily page views of over 86.3 million. To keep our
  sites running smoothly, we frequently have to monitor and trouble
  shoot our Java applications. In additional to the tools and
  utilities that come with Java, we also use a few free tools to get
  the job done. In this session, we will demonstrate how these tools
  can be used to monitor and trouble shoot some common problems that
  we have come across. There will also be a general
  question-and-answer and open discussion at the end for attendees to
  share their favorite tools, tricks, and/or best practices in
  monitoring and trouble shooting Java applications. In additional to
  covering the tools that comes with Java (jconsole, jhat, jinfo,
  jmap, jstat), we will also take about a few free tools that we
  use. We will demonstrate these tools by using them against sample
  Java programs that exhibit some of the problem that we have come
  across in our Java applications: memory leak, OutOfMemoryError, slow
  performance. After the demonstration, the floor will be open for
  question-and-answer and discussion with attendees. I plan to ask the
  participants to share their experience in the subject matter, along
  with their favorite tools, tricks, and best practices.

    applications on large clusters of commodity hardware.  The Hadoop
    framework transparently provides applications both reliability and
    data motion. Hadoop implements a distributed file system, similar
    to GFS, and MapReduce. This presentation presents the motivation
    and approach for Hadoop, an overview of the components and
    architecture, and an overview of the tools and applications built
    on top of Hadoop.

Abstract: >-

    Apache Hadoop is a software framework for running applications on
    large clusters built of commodity hardware.  Hadoop provides a
    distributed file-system and a parallel processing framework based
    on the Map-Reduce programming paradigm. Hadoop Map-Reduce is
    framework which simplifies writing efficient data-intensive
    (100's of terabytes) applications running on large clusters (1 to
    1000's of computers). This talk will describe how to use Hadoop
    Map/Reduce to write (and debug!) efficient scalable applications
    that can process large amounts of data. It will include
    discussions of the Java, C++, and Unix text filter interfaces to
    Hadoop Map/Reduce. It will also present a bried discussion on how
    to use Hadoop Map-Reduce via a simple query language called Pig
    (http://incubator.apache.org/pig/).

Abstract: >-

  Open Source will form the root of 70% of commercial software by
  2012 according to Gartner. Software developed at Apache will form a
  huge slice of that. The open source origins of business software
  mean that software is being driven into business use through the
  procurement process by vendors less and less. Instead, it is being
  adopted from the open source community. If we change the way we talk
  about software entering businesses we can also change a great deal
  of how others understand what is happening as well as understand
  open source business models more easily. This talk explores the
  adoption-led trend and paradigm and considers its consequences for
  the Open Source software movement and for the businesses engaging
  with it.

Abstract: >-

    Come learn how easy it is to build and deploy composite
    applications with Apache Tuscany. You will learn how to crate an
    SCA composite in a few minutes and then expand it to integrate
    with a Web 2.0 client application and backend data handling
    resources. In this session we will introduce SCA to give you an
    idea of what this SOA programming standard is about and help you
    understand how you can use Apache Tuscany or contribute to
    it. Apache Tuscany provides an infrastructure for developing and
    deploying composite applications in a distributed environment. It
    takes care of the complexity of environment that SOA developers
    typically need to deal with and instead allows them to focus on
    developing business logic.  Apache Tuscany goes beyond the SCA
    specification and is an environment for innovative ideas around
    SOA, for example it extends SCA to work with web2.0 and
    OSGI. Apache Tuscany is integrated with other Apache technologies
    such as Tomcat, Axis2, Geronimo, BSF, Ode, XMLBeans and Abdera.

    Sling is an OSGi-based scriptable applications layer, based on
    REST principles, that runs on top of a JCR content repository. In
    this talk, we'll see how Sling enables rapid development of
    JCR-based content applications, by leveraging the JSR 223
    scripting framework along with the rich set of OSGi components
    provided by Sling. We will create a simple application from
    scratch in a few minutes, and explain a more complex multimedia
    application that does a lot with few lines of code. This talk will
    help you get started with Sling and understand how the different
    components fit together.

Abstract: >-

  One very important functionality of modern extensible applications
    is support for developping such extensions in any scripting
    languages. Many scripting languages available today provide some
    sort of Java integration but each integration is different making
    it very difficult for the vendor of the application to support
    more than one scripting language.  Enter the Java Script API as
    defined in JSR-223. This API provides support for standardized
    integration of scripting languages in Java applications. Bindings
    already exist for a number fo scripting languages such as Groovy,
    JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Tcl. This session will show how easy it
    is to add scripting support to a Java application using the Java
    Scripting API and thus support whatever scripting language the
    user of the application likes to use. Practical demonstrations
    using Apache BSF 3.0 as the Java Scripting API implementation and
    Apache Sling as a Java application to be scripted will show how
    easy it is to add scripting support and to add scripting languages
    quickly and at runtime without even restarting the application.

Abstract: >-

  OSGi technology is becoming the preferred approach for creating
    highly modular and dynamically extensible applications. The
    Eclipse IDE was the first highly visible project to adopt OSGi
    technology a few years ago, but more and more projects are moving
    in the same direction (e.g., Spring, JOnAS) or considering it
    (e.g., Directory, Geronimo, JAMES, Jackrabbit). With Apache Felix
    readily available, there is no better time to start moving to OSGi
    technology. This talk will provide a status update on the Apache
    Felix project and will show in detail how to launch and embed the
    Apache Felix framework into your own projects and the issues
    around doing so. By attending this talk, you will receive enough
    information to immediately start using Apache Felix as a
    dynamically extensible plugin mechanism in your own applications,
    additionally providing them the benefits of module version
    management, dependency resolution, and life cycle control.

Abstract: >-

  Today's high-traffic websites must implement performance-boosting
    measures that cut down data processing and reduce load on the
    database, while increasing the speed of content delivery. One such
    method is the use of a cache to temporarily store whole pages,
    database recordsets, large objects, and sessions. While many
    caching mechanisms exist, memcached provides one of the fastest
    and easiest-to-use caching servers. This talk will cover memcached
    from setting up a memcached server to using it to provide a
    variety of caching solutions, including the use of memcached as a
    session data store. While this talk will focus on the use of the
    memcache extension for PHP, it will also briefly cover
    implementations in other languages. The caching principles
    illustrated can apply to all platforms.

    focus on anecdotes and strategies for keeping software design
    uncomplicated, making software fast, and putting usability above
    programming convenience. We'll also focus on the importance of
    keeping a healthy illusion of simplicity, while allowing

  This presentation begins with an examination of the fundamental
    architecture of a browser and its components to get a proper
    understanding of the full attack surface. The focus then moves to
    key concepts that are leveraged in practical exploitation of
    browsers. A few examples of popular browser exploits and an
    example "0-day" exploit shall be demonstrated. The talk also goes
    to show how the next generation of Javascript delivered exploits
    render current defense mechanisms useless. Antivirus programs and
    malware scanners are already being proved ineffective and cannot
    continue to identify and stop browser exploits in the future.  The
    talk then moves on to new proposed defense mechanisms that attack
    the very principles that browser exploits depend on.  We shall now
    introduce and demonstrate a few tools built on these defense
    principles and apply them against the exploits demonstrated. The
    talk shall then end with questions from the audience and some
    thoughts on how these tools can be further extended.

Abstract: >-

  You don't know Jack about Object Relational Mapping. So why are
    you considering using it? Keeping up with the Joneses?  There's a
    great community or two out there, and who doesn't need another
    community? It can cure cancer and leprosy, but you don't have
    cancer or leprosy... yet. You already know that modern
    applications are built using two very different technologies:
    Object-oriented programming for business logic, and relational
    databases for data storage. Object-oriented programming is a key
    technology for implementing complex systems, providing benefits of
    reusability, robustness, and maintainability. Relational databases
    provide data independence as repositories for persistent data.
    Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a bridge between the two that
    allows applications to access relational data in an
    object-oriented way. But ORM has a learning curve, just like any
    technology that tries to make complex programming issues
    simple. And if it takes longer to master the technology than it
    would have taken to build your own solution, is your c.v.  the
    only thing getting better? With the answers to five easy
    questions, you can determine whether ORM is right for you, with a
    93.5pct chance of success. Guaranteed.

  Many people think that certain server web languages are inherently
    insecure, since security vulnerabilities in applications driven by
    these languages are reported on a regular basis. However the
    actual problem is not the language, but insecure code written in
    it. This training provides you with best practices to write code
    that is as secure as possible. You will see various attacks and of
    course countermeasures. And although different languages offer
    different security features, a common understanding of standard
    attacks and security vulnerabilities is a must to write secure web
    applications — in any language. Ajax applications are especially
    endangered and require special precautions. A must-see training
    for any web developers who want to secure their applications on
    the code level.

  After a complete redesign of the original Apache Axis project, it
    is now between 3 and 6 times faster, and has very wide support for
    asynchronous and document based web services.  The architecture of
    Axis2 is highly flexible, and it supports many additional
    functionalities - such as reliable messaging and security - that
    are key for enterprises today. In this talk I will give an
    overview and briefly discuss the architecture of Axis2 and how
    services can be implemented or invoked. Then I will look into some
    real-life examples and see how the architecture and technology
    scale to solve customer problems. And finally I will delve into
    the performance of Axis2 and the core XML framework (Axiom),
    showing how Web Services can scale to support high transaction
    rates and heavy loads.

  Groovy is an open source dynamic language which runs on the
    JVM. Its goal is to bring lightweight, agile, and dynamic
    programming to the Java world. It encompasses powerful features
    from Ruby, Python, PERL and Smalltalk in an expressive and
    intuitive syntax while keeping the view and perspective of a Java
    programmer. Its seamless integration with Java makes it a perfect
    solution for enhancing your current Java projects with dynamic
    behavior. This tutorial takes you through all of the basics of
    programming with Groovy then examines common programming tasks
    like file processing, XML procesing, SQL processing. Finally, it
    touches upon some of the fun stuff like builders, closures,
    metaprogramming and more. Where appropriate Apache technologies
    will be used when illustrating Groovy examples.

    This training session will walk through the lifecycle of
    developing a typical Java application from creation to deployment,
    and show how to use Apache Maven most effectively to manage the
    build and development process. In addition to the fundamental
    building blocks of the project, the session will cover testing,
    day-to-day development in the IDE, setting up documentation,
    tracking development reports and practices, application of Maven
    best practices, effective dependency management, and establishing
    a release process. Effective use of continuous integration
    (illustrated with Apache Continuum) and repository management
    (using Apache Archiva) as a part of development infrastructure for
    team and enterprise environments will be demonstrated. This course

  Solr has emerged as THE way to add search services to applications
    written in any language. Lucene powers Solr's RESTful web
    services. This all-day tutorial will begin with a Solr overview,
    and move through installation and configuration. The bulk of
    session will be spent diving deeply into integrating Solr with
    various technologies. Solr features caching, replication support
    for load balancing, faceting, highlighting, more-like-this, simple
    HTTP protocol supporting XML, JSON, and other formats. Erik will
    discuss his Solr experiences on the applications he has built with
    it.

Abstract: >-

  As web applications move into a SOA environment, which is
    characterized by building applications from Web service
    components, many find that they are also building their Web UIs
    using a similar component model. Built from the on-screen assembly
    of Portlet components, Portals provide for the standardized
    delivery of aggregated, personalized, content.  JSR-286 is is the
    successor standard to JSR-168: the standard Portlet API for Java
    developers. This session will include coverage of the Portlet API,
    including new features in JSR-286, such as Events, Resource
    Serving, Portlet Filters, etc., in an interactive, hands-on,
    fashion. Note: This tutorial will be an interactive
    tutorial. Attendees should bring a laptop with either USB or
    CD-ROM support, and be prepared to develop Portlet code throughout
    the course of the workshop.

  You have adopted WS-* and have Web services, but Web services
  alone are not going to give you the SOA bang for the buck.  The full
  SOA picture is really about Business Processes, and that's where
  the Business Process Execution Language (aka BPEL or more formally
  WS-BPEL) comes in. In this session, we'll talk about the fuller SOA
  picture, the respective roles of Business Processes and Services,
  and BPEL. A VMware Virtual Machine will be provided, and we will be
  doing hands-on BPEL development, using various parts of the Apache
  SOA Stack, especially including our Apache ODE project for executing
  BPEL.

Abstract: >-

  Apache Lucene is a high-performance, cross-platform search API in
    production use in a large number of applications.  This tutorial
    will be an in-depth, hands-on class targeted at developers who
    wish to integrate Lucene Java into their applications. The full
    day tutorial will cover the key concepts behind Lucene, along with
    code examples, documentation and resources. Concepts covered are:
    Lucene setup; indexing content, indexing customization; searching,
    including how to use the many Lucene Query APIs to achieve better
    search results. Additionally, we will cover advanced topics like
    Lucene performance and threading issues, Span Queries, filters,
    term vectors, and sorting, all of which can help solve common
    problems in search applications. The class will gain hands-on
    experience with Lucene and leave with the know-how to build a
    Lucene-based application. No prior Lucene knowledge is required,
    but participants must be able to code in the Java programming
    language and come prepared to code.  Concepts learned can also be
    applied to Solr . Please refer to the Lucene Boot Camp website
    (http://www.lucenebootcamp.com) for more information on the class.

  The fastest way for you to learn everything you need to know about
  Tomcat. If you are an administrator, developer, release engineer, or
  perhaps a bit of all, then this training is for you. Whether you are
  an expert or a beginner, you are guaranteed to learn something new
  in this class. The curriculum spans from basic Tomcat configuration
  to advanced tuning of both Tomcat and the JVM. We'll go over
  several different deployment methodologies, with and without web
  server connectors, load balanced or not, and how to maximize the
  performance of Tomcat in your infrastructure. You'll learn how to
  troubleshoot Tomcat, how to classify different types of error
  messages and how to correctly reconfigure your server based on the
  actual error. Towards the end we will take a deep dive into the core
  of Tomcat, learning both architecture and code, and how to write
  your own Tomcat components.

  JSF is now a well known and widely used Java web-framework.
    Several extensions and component libaries are already
    existing. This training shows you a best of breed mixture.  We
    cover the basic concepts of JavaServer Faces technology.  After
    it, you build your first web application using JSF 1.2 with
    MyFaces and Facelets. This application will be ajaxified and
    enhanced with some cool components. In a best-practice JSF
    web-application advanced stuff like Spring 2.0 integration will be
    discussed as well. You can use it as an architectural base to
    start a new JSF project - also suitable for big enterprise
    projects. Attendees will get a very practial overview of what is
    possible with JSF today to build real world applications.

  When it comes to configuring webservers for performance, nothing
    beats getting your own hands dirty. In these sessions, we will use
    real live Unix installs hosted with technologies such as Amazon
    EC2 to get to grips with configuring and benchmarking Apache, and
    diagnosing and working around bottlenecks. Learn how to simulate
    load, how to trace a request and how to measure the effects of
    changes on the system.
