= Conferences

Simple conference management system for Radiant CMS 0.6.9.

This extension was specifically designed for ApacheCon and may still
contain several ApacheCon specific features.

== Basic model organization

 A Conference has one Venue with one or more Locations and one or more
 Tracks associated with a Location.  Users create Presentations which
 are submitted as Submissions to a Conference.  Submissions can then
 be approved and scheduled, becoming Scheduled Sessions associated
 with a Track in the Conference.  Activities are scheduled events
 associated with a Conference (and optionally a Track) that may have
 no associated User (such as a lunch or break).  Finally,
 Organizations can become Sponsors of a Conference.

== Requirements

The following other extensions or plugins should also be installed in
Radiant:

- radiant-members-extension (radiant extension)
- tinymce_filter (radiant extension)
- active_scaffold  (rails plugin)
- file_column (rails plugin)
- tzinfo_timezone (rails plugin)

== To Do

- The current set of migrations need refactored to work for a clean install
- RSpec tests need written
- Replace ActiveScaffold with custom, better designed forms
